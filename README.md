# Currently working on... 💦
- Mechanistic interpretability research: Supervised by Professor Hima Lakkaraju, focusing on mechanistic interpretability with AI safety-related applications. Specifically, I am looking at using probing to understand persona vectors in large language models, which may shed light onto certain safety-related behaviours such as deception, hallucination and sycophancy.
